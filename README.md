A digital version of the classic game. You can view the live project [here](https://xewar.github.io/battleship/).

**In this project I practiced:**

- Code:
  - test-driven development and unit testing with Jest
  - writing recursive functions to generate the computer/opponent's behavior

- Design
  - dragging and dropping objects


**Helpful Resources**

- [JavascriptTutorial.net](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-drag-and-drop/)'s tutorial on dragging and dropping.
- The battleship icon is by Atif Arshad, from the [Noun Project](NounProject.com)

**Potential future updates**

- Make the computer smarter so it guesses adjacent squares when it hits a human ship
- Add ghost versions of the ships so that you can visually track how many ships you've sunk
- Make the gameover message more prominent
