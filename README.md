A digital version of the classic game. You can view the live project [here](https://xewar.github.io/battleship/)

**Project Focus:**

- The purpose of this project was for me to practice developing with test-driven development and unit testing.

**Other Notes**

- This project also provided yet more practice with modules and I'm finally starting to feel a bit more comfortable with them
- I also practiced writing recursive functions - in this case to generate the computer opponent's behavior in the game.
- I got help from [JavascriptTutorial.net](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-drag-and-drop/) to learn how to make the ships drag + droppable.
- The battleship icon is by Atif Arshad from the [Noun Project](NounProject.com)

**Potential Next Steps**

- Make the computer smarter so it guesses adjacent squares when it hits a human ship
- Add ghost versions of the ships so that you can visually track how many ships you've sunk
- Make the gameover message more prominent
