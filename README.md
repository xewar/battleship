**Project Focus:**

- The purpose of this project was to use test-driven development and unit testing to develop the application logic for the game.

**Other Notes**

- This project provided yet more practice with modules and I'm finally starting to feel a little more comfortable with them
- Writing recursive functions - in this case to generate the computer opponent's behavior in the game.
- I got some help Help from [JavascriptTutorial.net](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-drag-and-drop/) to make the ships drag + droppable.
- The battleship icon is by Atif Arshad from the [Noun Project](NounProject.com)

**Potential Next Steps**

- Make the computer a bit smarter so it guesses adjacent squares if it hits a human ship
- add ghost versions of the ships so that you can visually track how many ships you've sunk versus not
- Make the gameover message more prominent
