# battleship

**Project Focus:**

- Practice test-driven development. I used tests to help develop the application logic for the game.

**Other**

- This project provided yet more practice with modules and I'm finally starting to feel a little more comfortable with them
- Writing recursive functions - in this case to generate the computer opponent's behavior in the game.
- I got some help Help from [JavascriptTutorial.net](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-drag-and-drop/) to make the ships drag + droppable.
- The battleship icon is by Atif Arshad from the [Noun Project](NounProject.com)

**Next Steps**

- I'm not sure if I'll revisit this project, but if I do I will make the computer a bit smarter so it guesses near its last guess when it hits the human's ship.
- Make the gameover message more prominent
